# matlab-digital-control
Repository for my and Pedro's Matlab codes used in the studies of digital control theory. The files here are related to the final project of the final discipline in my control theory studies in my graduation.

<h2>The project</h2>

In order to control a linearly acting servomechanism, different system identification methods are compared after modeling the physical system. Through an approach that considers the system as being of 2nd order and with modeling in state space, a proportional and integrative controller was developed via state feedback with observer to achieve the desired dynamic responses of the system. All calculations and simulations were developed using Matlab software and complete control validation was performed by Simulink.
